GrabDoc is a Blender add-on made to create a simple and streamlined workflow for exporting baked maps for trim sheets, tileables, alphas or even stamps. When installed all you need to do is run the one-click scene setup, and then start modeling! Whether you've modeled out your shapes or are still modeling them you can preview what the baked maps will look like in the viewport live! Once satisfied you can bake all maps using in-house options or even utilizing Marmoset Toolbag 3&4's baker for the best possible results!
