# Introduction

GrabDoc is a Blender 4+ add-on for quickly baking trim sheets and tileable texture maps.

After installation, run the one-click scene setup and then start modeling! GrabDoc provides a camera object with the ability to preview your rendered texture maps in real-time via custom shaders in Workbench, EEVEE, and Cycles. Once satisfied you can bake all maps using in-house options or even utilizing Marmoset Toolbag 4's baker for the best results!
